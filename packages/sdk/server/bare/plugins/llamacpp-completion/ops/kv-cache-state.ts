/**
 * Pure state + decision helpers for kv-cache bookkeeping used by
 * `completion-stream.ts`.
 *
 * This module intentionally has **no** `bare-*` imports so it can be
 * exercised directly from unit tests running under `bun` without pulling
 * in the Bare runtime (which is not available in that environment).
 * The file-system-dependent pieces (e.g. `recordCacheSaveCount`) live in
 * `completion-stream.ts` and consume the state exported here.
 *
 * History note (QVAC-18181, SDK 0.11.0): this module previously also
 * carried a per-model cancel counter (`modelCancelCounters` /
 * `noteCancelRequested` / `snapshotCancelCount`) used by `completion()`
 * to detect mid-decode cancellation. That side channel was retired
 * alongside the introduction of `RequestRegistry` — the in-flight
 * `RequestContext.signal` is now the single source of truth and
 * `completion-stream.ts` reads `signal.aborted` directly.
 */

/**
 * Number of chat messages the kv-cache file on disk is known to cover, keyed
 * by cache path. Written after a successful completion records a save, read
 * by `prepareMessagesForCache` to slice the history on the next turn so a
 * consumer can stage multiple messages between completions (e.g. an
 * `[assistant, user]` recovery sequence) without resending the whole history.
 *
 * INVARIANT: an entry is only present if the corresponding kv-cache file is
 * considered trustworthy. On any turn where the SDK cannot prove the saved
 * count reflects the on-disk state (cancellation mid-decode, zero-token
 * reply, cache file missing after a save attempt), the entry MUST be
 * deleted; a stale entry causes the next turn to slice its history down to
 * an empty payload and the model returns zero tokens.
 *
 * Mode notes:
 *   - Static-mode turns are the only readers of this map. `clearStaleCount`
 *     in `decideCachedHistorySlice` exists so a stale-but-non-zero entry
 *     can be detected and dropped on the next read.
 *   - Dynamic-mode turns do NOT consume this map — the addon trims tools
 *     and the chain output from the kv-cache after each round, so the
 *     SDK falls back to role-based dispatch in `prepareMessagesForCache`.
 *     Writes still happen on dynamic-mode turns, but the recorded count
 *     reflects the messages the SDK shipped, not the (possibly trimmed)
 *     on-disk cache shape. The map is internally consistent within a
 *     single mode; a `kvCache` key should not be reused across modes.

/**
 * Clear bookkeeping entries. With no argument, clears the whole map. With a

 *
 * Runtime callers MUST pass the platform path separator (e.g. `path.sep`
 * from `bare-path`) so directory-prefix matches are correct on every
 * target. The "/" default exists only for unit tests under `bun`, where
 * cache paths are POSIX-shaped and importing `bare-path` would pull in
 * the Bare runtime. The exported wrapper in `completion-stream.ts`
 * injects the real separator for in-process use.
