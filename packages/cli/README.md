# QVAC CLI

A command-line interface for the QVAC ecosystem. QVAC CLI provides tooling for building, bundling, and managing QVAC-powered applications.

This package is published to npm as **`@qvac/cli`** and lives in the QVAC monorepo at **`packages/cli`**. Older instructions may refer to the deprecated **`qvac-cli`** package name—use **`@qvac/cli`** instead.

## Installation

Install globally:

```bash
npm i -g @qvac/cli
```

Once installed, use the `qvac` command:

```bash
qvac <command>
```

Or run directly via npx:

```bash
npx @qvac/cli <command>
```

## Command Reference

### `doctor`

Validate that the current host can run `@qvac/sdk` + `@qvac/cli` before you
hit runtime errors. The command prints a human-readable report by default and
exits `1` when any required check fails.

```bash
qvac doctor [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output the report as JSON. |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress stdout — only set the exit code. |
| `-v, --verbose` | Detailed output. |

**What it checks:**

- **Runtime** — Node.js version (`>= 18`) and supported CLI host
  (desktop platforms only; Android/iOS are SDK deploy targets reported
  separately below).
- **Hardware** — total RAM, available RAM (via `os.availableMemory()` on
  Node 22+), GPU acceleration (Metal on macOS, `vulkaninfo` on
  Linux/Windows), and free disk space in the current working directory.
- **Deploy targets (SDK)** — desktop target matrix, Android (`adb`), and
  iOS (`xcodebuild` on macOS). Missing mobile toolchains produce
  warnings, not failures.
- **Optional tools** — `ffmpeg` (microphone/transcription), Bare runtime,
  Bun.
- **Project** — whether `@qvac/sdk` is resolvable from the current
  working directory (works for hoisted monorepo installs too).

See [`system-requirements.md`](./system-requirements.md) for the full list of
thresholds and rationale.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Human-readable report
qvac doctor

# JSON for CI / scripts
qvac doctor --json

# Fail-fast in a script (exit 1 on any required check)
qvac doctor --quiet || exit 1
```

### `bundle sdk`

Generate a tree-shaken Bare worker bundle containing the plugins you select (defaults to all built-in plugins).

```bash
qvac bundle sdk [options]
```

**What it does:**

1. Reads `qvac.config.*` from your project root (if present)
2. Resolves enabled plugins from the `plugins` array (defaults to all built-in plugins if omitted)
3. Generates worker entry files with **static imports only**
4. Bundles with `bare-pack --linked`
5. Generates `addons.manifest.json` from the bundle graph

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--config, -c <path>` | Config file path (default: auto-detect `qvac.config.*`) |
| `--host <target>` | Target host (repeatable, default: all platforms) |
| `--defer <module>` | Defer a module (repeatable, for mobile targets) |
| `--quiet, -q` | Minimal output |
| `--verbose, -v` | Detailed output |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Bundle with default settings (all platforms)
qvac bundle sdk

# Bundle for specific platforms only
qvac bundle sdk --host darwin-arm64 --host linux-x64

# Use a custom config file
qvac bundle sdk --config ./my-config.json

# Verbose output for debugging
qvac bundle sdk --verbose
```

**Output:**

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `qvac/worker.entry.mjs` | Standalone/Electron worker with RPC + lifecycle |
| `qvac/worker.bundle.js` | Final bundle for mobile runtimes (Expo/BareKit) |
| `qvac/addons.manifest.json` | Native addon allowlist for tree-shaking |

> **Note:** Your project must have `@qvac/sdk` installed.

### `verify deps`

Detect native Bare addon package changes between two git refs by comparing
npm `package-lock.json` contents.

```bash
qvac verify deps --base <ref> --head <ref> [options]
```

Both `--base` and `--head` are required.

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--base <ref>` | Base git ref or SHA. |
| `--head <ref>` | Head git ref or SHA. |
| `--lockfile <path>` | Path to npm `package-lock.json` (default: `package-lock.json`). |
| `--quiet, -q` | Suppress output when there are no native changes. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Local fork checkout
qvac verify deps --base upstream/main --head HEAD

# Direct clone where origin points at the canonical repo
qvac verify deps --base origin/main --head HEAD

# Package with a nested npm lockfile
qvac verify deps --base upstream/main --head HEAD --lockfile packages/sdk/package-lock.json
```

**Exit codes:**

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | No native addon changes, or no npm lockfile exists at either ref. |
| `1` | Native addon additions or removals were detected, or a removed package's native status could not be determined. Reviewers should confirm the change is intentional. |
| `2` | Tool error (missing required args, unsupported lockfile, git ref could not be resolved, lockfile read or parse failure, etc.). The check did not complete and no judgment about native dependency changes can be made. |

CI guardrails should treat `1` and `2` differently: `1` means "real native change to confirm", `2` means "infrastructure/usage problem to fix".

**Detection Capabilities:**

- Supports npm `package-lock.json` only.
- Yarn, Bun, and pnpm lockfiles are not parsed yet.
- Native packages are identified by reading installed `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` and checking for top-level `"addon": true`, so run from a checkout with dependencies installed for the head under review.
- Removed lockfile packages whose `package.json` is unavailable are reported with unknown native status so reviewers can inspect them.
- Packages with unreadable metadata are reported as warnings only when native addon changes are also reported.

## Configuration

The CLI reads configuration from `qvac.config.{json,js,mjs,ts}` in your project root.

If no config file is found, the CLI bundles all built-in plugins.

> **Note:** `qvac.config.ts` is supported via `tsx` internally (no user setup required).

This file is primarily the SDK runtime config, but `qvac bundle sdk` also reads this **bundler-only** key (ignored by the SDK at runtime):

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `plugins` | `string[]` | No | Module specifiers, each ending with `/plugin` (defaults to all built-in plugins) |

> **Custom plugin contract:** custom `*/plugin` modules must **default-export** the plugin object.

**Built-in plugins:**

```
@qvac/sdk/llamacpp-completion/plugin
@qvac/sdk/llamacpp-embedding/plugin
@qvac/sdk/whispercpp-transcription/plugin
@qvac/sdk/parakeet-transcription/plugin
@qvac/sdk/nmtcpp-translation/plugin
@qvac/sdk/onnx-tts/plugin
@qvac/sdk/onnx-ocr/plugin
@qvac/sdk/sdcpp-generation/plugin
```

**Example configurations:**

```json
// qvac.config.json - LLM only
{
  "plugins": [
    "@qvac/sdk/llamacpp-completion/plugin"
  ]
}
```

```json
// qvac.config.json - Multiple plugins
{
  "plugins": [
    "@qvac/sdk/llamacpp-completion/plugin",
    "@qvac/sdk/whispercpp-transcription/plugin",
    "@qvac/sdk/nmtcpp-translation/plugin"
  ]
}
```
