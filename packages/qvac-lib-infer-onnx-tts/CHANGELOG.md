## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-11

This release fixes CMake configuration errors that were preventing the TTS addon from building correctly with updated onnxruntime dependencies, and pins onnxruntime to a minimum version constraint to avoid future compatibility issues.

## Bug Fixes

### CMake Configuration Errors in onnxruntime Integration

Fixed build failures caused by incorrect onnxruntime target configuration in `CMakeLists.txt`. Three issues were resolved:

- A duplicate `find_package(onnxruntime CONFIG REQUIRED)` call was removed, which was causing the `safeint_interface` target to be defined twice and result in a build conflict.
- An `add_library(onnxruntime ALIAS onnxruntime::onnxruntime_static)` statement was removed — the `onnxruntime::onnxruntime_static` target does not exist in the package, making this ALIAS definition invalid.
- The `target_link_libraries` reference was corrected from `onnxruntime::onnxruntime_static` to `onnxruntime::onnxruntime`, matching the actual exported target name from the onnxruntime package.

### onnxruntime Version Constraint

Instead of bumping the vcpkg registry baseline, a `version>=: "1.24.2"` constraint has been added to all four `onnxruntime` dependency entries in `vcpkg.json`. This ensures a known-compatible minimum version is used across all platform-specific feature variants (NNAPI, DirectML, CoreML, and the default Linux build) without unnecessarily updating unrelated dependencies.

## [0.6.0]

### Changed
- Migrated the native addon implementation to `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` 1.x (`IModel` + `AddonJs`/`AddonCpp`), replacing the removed legacy templated addon API
- Updated JS/native runtime flow to `createInstance` + `runJob` semantics while preserving package-level behavior

### Fixed
- Removed nested `exclusiveRun` locking paths that could deadlock `run()`, `reload()`, or `unload()` when `exclusiveRun: true`

## [0.5.5]

### Added
- Fp16 quantization support for Chatterbox ONNX models (English and multilingual) in the C++ inference path; `Fp16Utils` module for fp16↔fp32 conversion and type-aware tensor read/write
- Refactored `ChatterboxEngine::synthesize()` into smaller, testable helpers; `IOnnxInferSession` interface and `OrtTypes.hpp` for clearer boundaries and session factory injection in tests
- Unit tests for `Fp16Utils`, ChatterboxEngine helpers, `OnnxInferSessionMock`, and factory injection; integration tests for `OnnxInferSession` and full Chatterbox synthesis (with optional model download via `models:ensure` script)
- C++ coverage and CI: workflow publishes test results to Checks, writes coverage summary to job summary; LLVM coverage symlinks and correct coverage paths in TTS C++ coverage workflow
- `models:ensure` script to download Chatterbox (en/multilingual, fp32/fp16) and Supertonic models; respects `CHATTERBOX_VARIANT`, `CHATTERBOX_LANGUAGE`; use `TTS_ENSURES=all` to ensure all variants

### Changed
- Checkout step in `cpp-test-coverage-qvac-lib-infer-onnx-tts.yml` and `integration-test-qvac-lib-infer-onnx-tts.yml` now uses `PAT_TOKEN` for PR/fork compatibility

## [0.5.4]

### Added
- Lazy ONNX session loading to reduce peak memory usage during synthesis, preventing out-of-memory kills on memory-constrained devices
  - Sessions created on demand during `synthesize()` and released when no longer needed
  - Controlled via `lazySessionLoading` option, defaults to `true` on iOS and `false` on other platforms

## [0.5.3]

### Added
- Multilingual support to the Chatterbox TTS engine, enabling speech synthesis in Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, and other languages

## [0.5.2]

### Added
- Test for automatic engine-type detection

### Changed
- Unit tests renamed and updated to use Supertonic engine configuration exclusively
- Regenerated NOTICE file

### Removed
- Legacy Piper engine references from the test suite
- eSpeak-specific JSDoc from `tts.js`

## [0.5.1]

### Changed
- README now covers both Chatterbox and Supertonic TTS engines with full usage guides, API references, and comparison

### Removed
- Legacy Piper and eSpeak-ng references from the benchmark suite
- `@qvac/dl-hyperdrive` dependency

## [0.5.0]

### Added
- Supertonic TTS engine with automatic engine detection based on configuration
- `SupertonicTTSArgs` TypeScript type and expanded `ONNXTTSArgs` union type
- Windows support for Supertonic
- Example script `examples/example-supertonic-tts.js`

## [0.4.0]

### Changed
- Addon now exclusively uses the Chatterbox engine
- Integration tests improved with real reference audio for voice cloning validation
- Consolidated test WAV utilities into `test/utils/wav-helper.js`

### Removed
- Piper TTS engine and all associated dependencies (`PiperTTSArgs`, `ENGINE_PIPER`, `TashkeelDiacritizer`, Piper vcpkg dependencies)
- Piper-specific examples and model downloads from CI workflows

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- Chatterbox TTS engine with voice cloning from reference audio
- Automatic engine detection based on configuration parameters
- Seven language support: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Russian
- Expanded TypeScript definitions (`ChatterboxTTSArgs`, `ONNXTTSArgs`)
- `OnnxInferSession` universal ONNX model inference session wrapper
- Example application for Chatterbox TTS
- Comprehensive integration and unit tests for Chatterbox

### Changed
- CI/CD pipeline now auto-installs Rust targets for iOS and Android cross-compilation
- Updated `tokenizers-cpp` (v0.1.1), vcpkg baseline, `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` to v0.12.2

### Fixed
- Windows-specific build issues
- Reference audio handling in integration tests

## [0.2.12]

### Changed
- Linux x64 build environment switched from Ubuntu 24.04 to Ubuntu 22.04 for oldest LTS compatibility
- Integration tests now run on both Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04

## [0.2.11]
