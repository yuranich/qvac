## [0.6.0]

In this release we reestablish the GGML implementation from `0.4.0` with extra additions. The main features are exposing the v2.1 streaming Sortformer model with NeMo-port AOSC (Audio-Online Speaker Cache) through the addon's public API and overhaul the Android prebuild to ship the ggml backends as separately-loadable MODULE `.so` files. v2.1 becomes the recommended streaming Sortformer model; v1 stays the offline-batch default. On the Android side, Vulkan and OpenCL ship as runtime-discovered `.so` files (qvac-ext-ggml@speech's `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON`), alongside per-arch CPU variants (`libqvac-speech-ggml-cpu-android_armv{8.0,8.2,8.6,9.0,9.2}_*.so`); inference still runs on CPU there pending Vulkan/Mali + OpenCL/Adreno driver fixes (`useGPU` is overridden at the engine boundary), but the GPU `.so` files are in place for when the override is lifted.

### Added
- **AOSC config knobs.** `ParakeetConfig` gains six optional fields — `streamingSpkCacheEnable` (default `true`), `streamingSpkCacheLen` (188), `streamingFifoLen` (188), `streamingChunkLeftContextMs` (80), `streamingChunkRightContextMs` (560), `streamingSpkCacheUpdatePeriod` (144) — forwarded into `parakeet::SortformerStreamingOptions` for both the in-process Mode-3 streaming path (`ParakeetModel::runStreamingProcess_`) and the duplex `runStreaming()` processor (`ParakeetStreamingProcessor`). Mirrored as per-call overrides on `StreamingRunConfig` (`spkCacheEnable`, `spkCacheLen`, `fifoLen`, `chunkLeftContextMs`, `chunkRightContextMs`, `spkCacheUpdatePeriod`). parakeet-cpp ignores these on v1 / v2 Sortformer GGUFs and on non-Sortformer engines, so always-forward is safe.
- **v2.1 Sortformer auto-detection.** When a `diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1.*` GGUF is loaded, parakeet-cpp's engine recognises it from the GGUF metadata tag `parakeet.model_variant == "sortformer-streaming-v2.1-aosc"` and enables AOSC by default. Setting `streamingSpkCacheEnable: false` forces the v1 sliding-window code path on a v2.1 model (A/B comparison).
- **`examples/live-mic-diarized-aosc.js`** — v2.1-focused dual-stream live mic example mirroring `live-mic-diarized.js`'s ASR + Sortformer pattern, with CLI flags for every AOSC knob (`--spk-cache-enable`, `--spk-cache-len`, `--fifo-len`, `--chunk-left-context-ms`, `--chunk-right-context-ms`, `--spk-cache-update-period`).
- **`test/integration/sortformer-aosc-streaming.test.js`** — covers default-AOSC streaming and `streamingSpkCacheEnable=false` fallback. The full AOSC slot-stability contract (same physical speaker → same `Speaker N` tag across non-contiguous re-entries) is verified at C++ level in `parakeet-cpp/test/test_sortformer_aosc_speakers.cpp`; this JS-level test focuses on wiring correctness — that the override actually reaches the engine and the engine emits well-formed segments in both modes.
- **`MODEL_CONFIGS.sortformerStreaming`** entry in `test/integration/helpers.js` pointing at `diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1.q8_0.gguf`. Tests skip cleanly when the GGUF isn't staged via `npm run setup-models` / `QVAC_TEST_GGUF_*`.
- **`backendsDir` ParakeetConfig field.** Directory the native addon scans for dynamically-loaded ggml backend libraries (`libqvac-speech-ggml-vulkan.so`, `libqvac-speech-ggml-opencl.so`, per-arch `libqvac-speech-ggml-cpu-android_armv*_*.so`).
- **`openclCacheDir` ParakeetConfig field.** Persistent directory for ggml-opencl's `clCreateProgramWithBinary` cache.
- **CMake install plumbing for dynamic ggml backends.** Two complementary install paths cover the full backend set that the `ggml-speech` vcpkg port emits on Android.
- **`BACKENDS_SUBDIR` compile define** on the addon target. Derived from cmake-bare's `bare_target()` + `bare_module_target()` so the addon can join `<bare-target>/<module-name>` onto the host-provided `backendsDir` root without the host needing to know the per-target shape.
- **Mobile dynamic-backend coverage.** `test/mobile/integration-runtime.cjs` now sets `NO_GPU=false` so Device Farm runs `gpu-smoke` and `mobile-perf-*-gpu` tests that exercise backend dlopen / discovery (Vulkan, OpenCL, and per-arch CPU `.so` loading). On Android, inference still runs on CPU (`useGPU` is overridden at the engine boundary and gpu-smoke passes early); iOS may engage Metal when `useGPU: true`.

### Changed
- **parakeet-cpp dep bumped** to `version>= 2026-05-20#2` (was `2026-05-05#1`) across all three platform branches in `vcpkg.json`. The new port (qvac-registry-vcpkg PR #156 + the `ggml-speech#3` follow-up) pulls in PRs #22 + #24 of `qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp`, which introduce the v2.1 Sortformer support, AOSC engine implementation, strict variant detection via the `parakeet.model_variant` GGUF tag, and review-fixup cleanups (magic-number elimination, dead-code removal, test utility consolidation, Windows `<algorithm>` include), and tightens the `ggml-speech` constraint to the per-arch Android CPU build (`GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON`).
- **`index.js::_buildConfigurationParams()`** now forwards the 6 new AOSC fields (and explicit defaults for unset values) into `createInstance` / `reload`. Without this, JSDoc + native plumbing would exist but JS-layer overrides would never reach C++.
- **`examples/live-mic-diarized.js`** header: recommends the v2.1 GGUF as `--diar-model` and notes that `streamingHistoryMs` is superseded by AOSC on v2.1 models (kept for v1 back-compat). Points to the new `live-mic-diarized-aosc.js` for explicit knob control.
- **`examples/diarized-transcribe.js`** header: notes v1 remains the recommended OFFLINE diarization model — AOSC's slot-stability benefit only applies to continuous streaming and is wasted in batch mode.
- **`README.md`** — extended Model Variants table with v1 (offline default) and v2.1 + AOSC (streaming default) rows; new `streamingSpkCache*` rows in the ParakeetConfig table; dedicated "Sortformer Streaming Diarization (v2.1 + AOSC)" section explaining the v1-drift problem AOSC solves, the model-variant auto-detection, and when to leave the defaults alone.

## [0.5.0]

- Temporarily reverted back to ONNX implementation of `0.3.3` to ensure stability in SDK `0.11.*`.
- Bumped `inference-addon-cpp` dependency version to `1.1.7#1`.
- Bumped `onnx` dependency version to `0.15.0`.

## [0.4.0]

In this release, we have replaced the onnxruntime backend with a pure C++/ggml engine, added a duplex-streaming entry point that bypasses the framework's batch-then-process lifecycle for live use cases, and surfaced two new per-segment signals (`isEndOfTurn`, `startsWord`) so consumers can build cleaner live transcripts. The release also exposes per-engine backend stats (`backendDevice`, `backendId`) so callers can verify the GPU path actually engaged, and consolidates the examples / docs / mock fixtures into a single duplex-aware surface.

### Changed (BREAKING for model files)
- Replaced the onnxruntime backend with the parakeet-cpp backend. The native addon no longer ships ONNX Runtime; the ggml dependency is now provided by the dedicated `ggml-speech` vcpkg port (separate from the `parakeet-cpp` port itself), with a `qvac-speech-` library prefix so it can coexist with the fabric/llm `qvac-` and the diffusion `qvac-diffusion-` ggml flavours on the same Android device.
- Models now load from a single `.gguf` file per checkpoint instead of the legacy multi-file ONNX layout. Tokenizer + hyperparameters travel inside the GGUF metadata; no side-loaded files.
- `loadWeights({ filename, chunk, completed })` now expects a single `.gguf` filename. Non-`.gguf` filenames are ignored with a warning for back-compat with callers still iterating an ONNX file list.
- `Engine::transcribe_stream` and `StreamSession` are wired through the new backend; existing `is_eou_boundary` + `eot_confidence` slots on `StreamingSegment` now reflect parakeet-cpp's native EOU `<EOU>` token detection.
- `runtimeStats()` now returns (`encoderMs`, `decoderMs`, `melSpecMs`, `totalEncodedFrames`, `backendDevice`, `backendId`) besides existing stats. `backendDevice` (0 = CPU, 1 = GPU) and `backendId` (`BackendId` enum: 0=CPU, 1=Metal, 2=CUDA, 3=Vulkan, 4=OpenCL, 99=other) are captured once at `loadModel()` from `parakeet::Engine::backend_device()` / `backend_name()` and reflect the post-fallback truth -- a `useGPU: true` request that silently falls back to CPU at runtime surfaces as `backendDevice: 0` / `backendId: 0`.

### Added
- **Duplex streaming entry point.** `TranscriptionParakeet.runStreaming(audioStream, streamingConfig?)` opens a long-lived `parakeet::StreamSession` (or `SortformerStreamSession`) on the C++ side and feeds each pushed chunk straight in -- bypassing the `run()` path's append-buffer-then-process lifecycle. Per-chunk segments surface through the regular `onUpdate(...)` channel as soon as the engine emits them, with full streaming session state (rolling encoder context, EOU detector, Sortformer history) preserved across chunks. The lower-level `startStreaming` / `appendStreamingAudio` / `endStreaming` / `cancelStreaming` methods are exposed on `ParakeetInterface` for callers that want to drive the session manually. New `StreamingRunConfig` type for per-call `chunkMs` / `historyMs` / `leftContextMs` / `rightLookaheadMs` / `emitPartials` / `emitEnergyVad` overrides.
- **C++ `ParakeetStreamingProcessor`** (mirrors transcription-whispercpp's `StreamingProcessor`): a worker-thread-driven class that owns the duplex session lifetime, drains audio from a `pending_` queue under `mtx_+cv_`, calls `feed_pcm_f32` directly, and queues per-segment `Transcript`s into `addonCpp->outputQueue` so the JS `onUpdate` channel surfaces them with no batching. New binding entry points wire in via `qvac_lib_infer_parakeet::{startStreaming,appendStreamingAudio,endStreaming,cancelWithStreaming,destroyInstanceWithStreaming}` in `AddonJs.hpp`.
- `TranscriptionSegment.isEndOfTurn` boolean field. EOU streaming sessions set this on every segment whose chunk contained an `<EOU>` token, so consumers can detect end-of-turn boundaries independently of segment text. CTC / TDT / Sortformer always leave the field `false`. Replaces the never-fired synthetic `<EOU>` text marker that earlier 0.4.0 builds attempted to surface.
- `TranscriptionSegment.startsWord` boolean field. Forwarded from the upstream `parakeet::StreamingSegment::starts_word` flag, which is set true when the segment's first token is a SentencePiece word-start (the piece begins with the `▁` U+2581 marker). Streaming consumers building a running transcript can use it to gate the inserted separator: concatenate verbatim when `startsWord === false` to rejoin chunk-boundary wordpiece splits like `["pun", "ctuation"]` into `"punctuation"` instead of `"pun ctuation"`. Default `true` so callers that ignore it see no behaviour change.
- `streamingLeftContextMs` and `streamingRightLookaheadMs` config knobs. Forwarded to `parakeet::StreamingOptions::left_context_ms` / `right_lookahead_ms`. ASR sessions only (Sortformer ignores them). `-1` keeps parakeet-cpp's defaults (10000 / 2000 ms). `right_lookahead_ms` adds directly to the per-segment latency floor; tune lower for snappier live transcripts at the cost of chunk-boundary accuracy.
- Long-form audio support for the TDT engine carries over from 0.3.3 (`runEncoderChunked`-style mel-spectrogram windowing) but is now handled natively by the parakeet-cpp engine's `transcribe_samples` / `StreamSession` paths -- no addon-side chunked driver needed.
- Four flag-driven examples that replaced the old per-model quickstart: `examples/transcribe.js` (any GGUF, all engine types), `examples/diarized-transcribe.js` (combined Sortformer + ASR), `examples/live-mic.js` (default-device live transcription via `sox`, now using `runStreaming` for sub-second latency), and `examples/live-mic-diarized.js` (live mic with parallel Sortformer + ASR for speaker-tagged transcripts).
- `scripts/download-models.sh` (downloads upstream NeMo `.nemo`) and `scripts/convert-nemo.sh` (wraps qvac-parakeet.cpp's `convert-nemo-to-gguf.py`); `npm run setup-models` runs both.
- `test/integration/eou-streaming.test.js` covering the EOU streaming session's `isEndOfTurn` boundary detection.
- `test/integration/duplex-streaming.test.js` -- end-to-end coverage for `runStreaming()`: asserts segments arrive BEFORE the input is exhausted (genuine streaming-out, not batched in JS) and that the response settles cleanly after `endStreaming`.
- `test/integration/gpu-smoke.test.js` -- flips `useGPU: true` across all four model types (CTC / TDT / EOU / Sortformer) and gates strictly on `response.stats.backendDevice` + `backendId`. `QVAC_PARAKEET_GPU_SMOKE_RELAX=1` downgrades the gate to a warning (Adreno-6xx phones where ggml-opencl rejects the device by design, Android emulator / iOS simulator without GPU support, Linux / Windows hosts without a Vulkan-capable GPU or Vulkan SDK).
- `test/unit/streaming-duplex.test.js` -- mock-binding unit coverage for the JS duplex plumbing (`runStreaming` round-trips through `startStreaming` / `appendStreamingAudio` / `endStreaming` without buffering, `cancel` routes through the streaming-aware C++ shim, append without an active session throws).
- English-CTC accuracy assertion in `test/integration/accuracy-multilang.test.js` (was previously TDT/EOU only); WER coverage for all three ASR heads now lives there.
- `BackendId` enum exported from `index.d.ts` (CPU / Metal / CUDA / Vulkan / OpenCL / other), backing the new `RuntimeStats.backendDevice` / `backendId` fields. See `index.d.ts` for the numeric codes and the per-platform GPU policy.
- `examples/decode-audio.js` -- same flag surface as `examples/transcribe.js`, but pipes audio through `@qvac/decoder-audio` (FFmpeg) before inference so any container / codec FFmpeg supports (mp3, m4a, ogg, flac, mp4, ...) works, not just 16 kHz mono `.wav` / raw s16le PCM.
- `scripts/setup-venv.sh` + `scripts/requirements.txt` -- idempotent local Python venv bootstrap for `convert-nemo-to-gguf.py` (CPython 3.10+; pins `nemo_toolkit`, `huggingface_hub`, `sentencepiece`, ...). Driven by `npm run setup:venv` and transitively by `npm run setup-models`.

### Removed
- `@qvac/onnx` peer dependency; `eigen3`, `qvac-onnx` cmake config, ONNX file-name lists in `examples/utils.js`.
- `@qvac/dl-base` and `@qvac/dl-filesystem` devDependencies, and `bare-buffer` -- no longer needed: weights flow through the framework's `loadWeights` callback against the single `.gguf` file, and `bare-buffer` was only an examples-side helper.
- `examples/quickstart-{ctc,eou,sortformer,diarized,ggml}.js` and `examples/quickstart.js` (folded into `examples/transcribe.js`).
- `examples/example.decoder.js` (superseded by `examples/decode-audio.js`).
- `examples/samples/two-speakers-16k.wav`, replaced by `examples/samples/jfk.wav` and `examples/samples/sample_mp3.mp3` so the new decode + live-mic examples have non-WAV input fixtures.
- 4 ONNX-specific integration tests (`external-data-staging`, `individual-file-paths`, `named-paths-all-models`, `named-paths-reload`).
- `test/integration/addon.test.js` (legacy generic addon-lifecycle integration test; superseded by `addon-multimodel.test.js` and `eou-streaming.test.js`).
- `test/mocks/loader.fake.js` and `test/mocks/test.models.json` -- unused after the constructor `loader` argument was dropped in 0.3.0 and the multi-file ONNX model manifest stopped existing.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `QUICKSTART.md` (folded into the README).
- `addon/CMakeLists.txt` -- the addon subproject is now driven directly from the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Dead code: `addon/src/model-interface/parakeet/ParakeetHandlers.{hpp,cpp}` (unused handler maps + `MiscConfig` + `computeOptimalThreads()`), `JSAdapter::loadMap`, and the `JSValueVariant` typedef -- no consumers anywhere in the package since the JSAdapter rewrite went direct via `getOptionalProperty<>()`.

### Fixed
- **Data race in `ParakeetModel::cancel()`.** `asr_session_` / `diar_session_` reads now sit under a dedicated `session_mutex_` so they cannot race against `openStreamingSession_()` / `closeStreamingSession_()` / `endOfStream()` / `~ParakeetModel`. The framework documents `cancel()` as concurrent with `process()`/`unload()`/`reload()`, and the previous unsynchronised access could deref a torn `unique_ptr`. `closeStreamingSession_()` uses a snapshot-and-release pattern (move ownership out under the lock, run the session destructor outside) so a concurrent `cancel()` can never observe a half-destroyed session.
- **Double-join race in `ParakeetStreamingProcessor`.** `end()` / `cancel()` / `~ParakeetStreamingProcessor`'s fallback `cancel()` now serialise through a `std::once_flag teardown_once_` so `thread_.join()` runs at most once across the three paths. Without this, a race between `end()` and `cancel()` (or two `cancel()` calls) could pass `thread_.joinable()` simultaneously and the loser's `join()` would raise `std::system_error`.
- **`runAsrProcess_` encoder-time mis-attribution.** Per-stage timings now record verbatim from `parakeet::EngineResult`. The earlier wall-clock fallback (substitute `transcribe_samples`'s total when `encoder_ms == 0`) silently rolled mel + decoder time into the encoder bucket, inflating it roughly 3-5x on the first call.
- **`_runInternal` / `_runStreamingInternal` job leak on synchronous kickoff failure.** `_runInternal` now wraps the `_normalizeAudioStream` call in `try/catch` -> `_job.fail(error); throw` so a synchronous throw (e.g. `null` input) doesn't leave `_job.active === true` for the next `run()`. `_runStreamingInternal` similarly wraps the `await this.addon.startStreaming(...)` call so a rejected `startStreaming` (engine not loaded, `dynamic_cast` failure, session already populated, ...) fails the job before propagating.

### Changed (docs / behaviour clarifications)
- **Cross-call streaming-state scope**, spelled out everywhere it was implied: `index.d.ts`, `index.js`, `parakeet.js`, README's `streaming` row, `ParakeetConfig.hpp`'s comment, and the inline comment in `runStreamingProcess_`. Within a single `run()` call the streaming session preserves state (Sortformer speaker history, EOU rolling window, partial decode state); across separate `run()` calls on the same model instance, the session is closed and reopened, so cross-call state is lost. For continuous live capture, drive a single long-running `run()` from a pushable stream, or use `runStreaming()` (which owns one streaming session for the lifetime of the call regardless of append count).
- **`endStreaming()` synthetic `JobEnded` now reports real stats.** The C++ `cleanupStreamingSession()` returns `{ cleaned, audioDurationMs, totalSamples }` captured from `ParakeetStreamingProcessor::audioSeconds()` right after the worker thread joins. JS plumbs those into the synthetic `JobEnded` payload so consumers reading `response.stats.audioDurationMs` / `totalSamples` after a duplex `runStreaming()` get a non-zero value (the framework's `RuntimeStats` path is bypassed by the duplex processor entirely).
- **`ParakeetModel::reload()`** now throws an explicit `InternalError` when `cfg_.modelPath` is empty -- the in-memory `gguf_buffer_` is dropped on `unload()`, so a model originally loaded from streamed bytes without a temp file would otherwise fail mid-load with a less obvious error.
- **ASR streaming default `chunk_ms`** is now 2000 (was 1000) when `streamingChunkMs <= 0`, matching the documented default in README / `index.d.ts` / `index.js`.
- **`streamingHistoryMs` warning** logged when set on a non-Sortformer (CTC / TDT / EOU) instance, since the option is silently ignored for ASR streaming sessions.
- **`parakeet.js` `_addonOutputCallback`** event mapping trusts explicit `'Output' / 'JobEnded' / 'Error'` event strings verbatim and only falls back to data-shape sniffing when the event is unrecognised, preventing silent misclassification if a future framework event happens to share a key name.
- **`parakeet.js` `pause()` / `status()`** JSDoc now explicitly notes these are JS-side state-machine flips that don't reach the native engine; use `cancel()` / `stop()` to actually abort an inference call.
- **`index.d.ts`** Vulkan doc now reflects reality (`enabled on Linux / Windows / Android via parakeet-cpp[vulkan]`) instead of "not yet enabled".
- **README's Stage-a-Model section** lists `sentencepiece` as a venv requirement (matching `scripts/requirements.txt`); `convert-nemo-to-gguf.py` raises a clear actionable error if `huggingface_hub` is missing instead of opaque `ImportError` (with a pointer at `download-models.sh`, the documented entry point that needs no Python deps for download).
- **README's Run Inference section** calls out the 500 MiB `MAX_BUFFERED_BYTES` cap on a single `run()` call (~4 hours of 16 kHz int16 audio) so consumers picking `run()` over `runStreaming()` for very long captures know to split into sequential calls (or use `runStreaming` instead, which has no per-call buffer cap).
- **`ParakeetModel::addTranscription`** now annotated as test-only.
- **`ParakeetModel::endOfStream` / `isStreamEnded`** now annotated as framework-only -- the duplex `runStreaming()` path (`ParakeetStreamingProcessor`) owns its own session and never sets `stream_ended_`, so consumers must not gate cleanup on `isStreamEnded()` after `runStreaming()`.
- **`package.json` dependency reshuffle.** `bare-subprocess` added as a runtime dependency (the new `live-mic*` examples spawn `sox` through it). `bare-process` moved from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` (examples / tests only). `typescript` added as a devDependency so `test:dts` can lint both `index.d.ts` and `addonLogging.d.ts` under `--lib es2018 --esModuleInterop --skipLibCheck`. The old `path` / `process` npm aliases (`path: npm:bare-path`, `process: npm:bare-process`) are gone -- consumers should `require('bare-path')` / `require('bare-process')` directly.

## [0.3.3]

This release adds long-form audio support to the Parakeet TDT pipeline. Audio inputs that previously failed against the encoder's static positional-encoding ceilings are now transcribed by streaming the mel-spectrogram through the encoder in overlapping windows.

### Added

- **Long-form audio support for the TDT encoder.** The exported encoder graph has hard-coded positional-encoding length ceilings (a long-range bucket of 9999 frames and a tighter relative bucket of 3000 frames). Inputs longer than ~240s of audio (~24000 mel frames, the binding 3000-frame bucket × 8× subsampling) previously could not be transcribed in a single TDT call. A new `runEncoderChunked` path slides over the mel-spectrogram in ~200s windows with ~20s of shared context, runs the existing encoder per window, trims half of the overlap from each interior boundary so the concatenated output is gap-free and duplicate-free along the time axis, and feeds a single merged `[ENCODER_DIM, T]` buffer to `greedyDecode`. Short audio (≤ one window) keeps the original single-pass path with zero overhead. Cancellation is honored between windows. The chunk/overlap constants are guarded by a compile-time `static_assert` against the encoder's positional-encoding ceiling so future tuning fails to build rather than silently producing invalid windows.

## [0.3.2]

### Fixed
- Fixed model activation failure on Windows when the user lacks `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`. The external data staging in `loadTDTSessions` and `loadCTCSessions` now uses a symlink → hardlink → copy fallback chain. Staging directories are created next to the model files so hardlinks stay on the same volume, avoiding unnecessary multi-GB copies.

### Added
- Integration test `external-data-staging.test.js` that validates model loading with external data files (`.onnx.data`) via the staging fallback mechanism.

## [0.3.1]

### Added
- Registered ONNX Runtime execution providers for GPU acceleration when `useGPU: true` is set. The `useGPU` config flag was previously accepted but never applied to session creation. Platform EPs are now active: CoreML (macOS/iOS), DirectML (Windows), NNAPI (Android). Falls back to CPU automatically if the GPU provider fails.

### Changed
- Session options are now built via `onnx_addon::buildSessionOptions()` from `@qvac/onnx`, replacing manual `Ort::SessionOptions` construction. This aligns Parakeet with the same EP registration logic used by the OCR package.

## [0.3.0]

This release replaces the two-argument `TranscriptionParakeet` constructor with a clean single-options interface, removes the external loader dependency, and simplifies the internal job-management pipeline.

## Breaking Changes

### Unified constructor interface — `new TranscriptionParakeet({ files, config })`

The constructor signature has changed from the legacy two-argument form `(args, config)` to a single `opts` object. The old `args` accepted `loader`, `modelName`, and `diskPath`; the old `config` held all named file paths at the top level. The new interface groups model file paths under a `files` map and non-path settings under `config`.

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const model = new TranscriptionParakeet(
  { loader, modelName, diskPath },
  {
    encoderPath: '/path/to/encoder-model.onnx',
    decoderPath: '/path/to/decoder_joint-model.onnx',
    vocabPath: '/path/to/vocab.txt',
    preprocessorPath: '/path/to/preprocessor.onnx',
    parakeetConfig: { modelType: 'tdt', maxThreads: 4, useGPU: false }
  }
)
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
const model = new TranscriptionParakeet({
  files: {
    encoder: '/path/to/encoder-model.onnx',
    decoder: '/path/to/decoder_joint-model.onnx',
    vocab: '/path/to/vocab.txt',
    preprocessor: '/path/to/preprocessor.onnx'
  },
  config: {
    parakeetConfig: { modelType: 'tdt', maxThreads: 4, useGPU: false }
  }
})
```

### `downloadWeights()` removed

The public `downloadWeights()` method has been removed. External weight downloading is no longer part of this package's responsibility. Use the `files` map to supply pre-downloaded model paths directly.

### `BaseInference` inheritance removed

`TranscriptionParakeet` no longer extends `BaseInference` and no longer depends on `WeightsProvider`. It is now a self-contained class that manages its own logger, run queue, and job lifecycle.

## New APIs

### `TranscriptionParakeetFiles`

A new exported `TranscriptionParakeetFiles` interface captures all model file paths accepted by the constructor:

```typescript
interface TranscriptionParakeetFiles {
  encoder?: string;      // TDT encoder-model.onnx
  encoderData?: string;  // TDT encoder-model.onnx.data
  decoder?: string;      // TDT decoder_joint-model.onnx
  vocab?: string;        // TDT vocab.txt
  preprocessor?: string; // TDT preprocessor.onnx
  model?: string;        // CTC model.onnx
  modelData?: string;    // CTC model.onnx_data
  tokenizer?: string;    // CTC/EOU tokenizer.json
  eouEncoder?: string;   // EOU encoder.onnx
  eouDecoder?: string;   // EOU decoder_joint.onnx
  sortformer?: string;   // sortformer.onnx
}
```

### `status()`, `pause()`, `unpause()`

Three new public methods expose addon lifecycle control: `status()` queries the native addon status, `pause()` suspends inference, and `unpause()` resumes it.

## Other

Job management is now handled by `createJobHandler()` from `@qvac/infer-base ^0.4.0`, replacing the manual `_hasActiveResponse` flag and `_failAndClearActiveResponse()` helper. `_resolveFilePath()` now takes only a `filename` argument. Dead helpers `_hasNamedPaths()` and `_getModelFilePath()` have been removed.

## [0.2.7]

### Changed
- Bumped `inference-addon-cpp` to `1.1.5`.
- Restored JS-owned job ID routing after addon-cpp reverted the accidental `1.1.3` native callback `jobId` contract and `cancel(jobId)` API break.

### Added
- Regression coverage for JS-owned cancel handling of active, buffered, and stale wrapper job IDs.

## [0.2.6]

### Changed
- Switched ONNX Runtime linkage from direct vcpkg dependency to `@qvac/onnx` shared module, aligning with the OCR package pattern for consistent cross-addon runtime sharing

## [0.2.5]

### Changed
- Switched desktop Parakeet prebuilds to static ONNX Runtime linking so packaged platform artifacts stay as a single `.bare` addon plus exports file
- Aligned the secondary native build path and Linux linkage behavior with the desktop packaging update to keep runtime loading working after removing bundled shared libraries

### Fixed
- Apple prebuild compatibility by replacing the `std::ranges::find` sample-rate check with a `std::find` implementation that works on the current Xcode toolchains

## [0.2.4]

Security hardening release from comprehensive security audit.

### Fixed
- Add 500 MB buffer limit to audio accumulation to prevent OOM from unbounded buffering (#1080)
- Add SHA-256 integrity verification to model download scripts using HuggingFace LFS checksums (#1081)
- Sanitize error messages to remove filesystem paths from thrown errors (#1084)
- Wrap job ID counter at `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` to prevent precision loss (#1085)
- Harden benchmark server: add library allowlist, restrict file paths to allowed directories, remove dynamic `npm install`, add body size limit, restrict CORS to localhost (#1086)

## [0.2.3]

### Added
- RTF benchmark integration test (`rtf-benchmark.test.js`) that captures Real-Time Factor and 12 other timing metrics from the C++ addon's `runtimeStats` callback
- `test:benchmark:rtf` npm script for on-demand RTF benchmark runs
- RTF benchmark step in integration test CI workflow (non-blocking, all 6 runners) with JSON artifact upload

## [0.2.2]

This release documents Parakeet runtime statistics and transcription output in TypeScript so consumers can type `response.stats` and `run()` results against the native addon.

## New APIs

### `RuntimeStats` and `ParakeetRunOutput` in `index.d.ts`

The `TranscriptionParakeet` namespace now exports **`RuntimeStats`**, aligned with `ParakeetModel::runtimeStats()` (throughput, audio duration, token and transcription counts, pipeline timing fields through `totalEncodedFrames`). **`ParakeetRunOutput`** is **`TranscriptionSegment[] | TranscriptionSegment`**, matching array or single-segment updates from the addon. **`run()`** is typed to return **`Promise<QvacResponse<ParakeetRunOutput>>`**, with documentation that **`response.stats`** matches **`RuntimeStats`** when stats collection is enabled via `opts.stats`.

## [0.2.1]

This release fixes `reload()` for setups that use per-file model paths (TDT, CTC, EOU, Sortformer), so the native addon keeps receiving the same paths after a reload as on the initial load.

## Bug Fixes

### reload() missing named path passthrough

`reload()` rebuilt configuration without the individual file paths (`encoderPath`, `decoderPath`, `vocabPath`, and the other named path fields). After `reload()`, the addon no longer saw those paths and could not load the model correctly. `reload()` now builds configuration through the same `_buildConfigurationParams()` helper as `_load()`, so named paths are always included. When named paths are in use, `reload()` also skips streaming weights via `_loadModelWeights`, matching initial load behavior and avoiding redundant large file reads.

## Added

### Integration coverage for reload with named paths

A new integration test exercises `TranscriptionParakeet` with TDT named paths: transcribe, call `reload()` with updated `parakeetConfig`, then transcribe again and verify output quality.

## [0.2.0]

### Changed
- Migrated the native addon implementation to `inference-addon-cpp` 1.x (`IModel`/`IModelCancel` + `AddonJs`/`AddonCpp`), replacing the removed legacy templated addon API
- Updated the JS/native pipeline to `createInstance` + `runJob` while preserving public transcription API behavior and output semantics
- Hardened cancel/reload/job lifecycle behavior in runtime and integration paths to match expected production behavior

### Added
- Dedicated `AddonCpp` test coverage plus expanded cancellation and lifecycle regression coverage for the addon-cpp runtime path

## [0.1.11]

### Changed
- All model types (TDT, CTC, EOU, Sortformer) now require named file paths — buffer-based `_loadModelWeights` fallback removed
- `_hasNamedPaths()` unified to cover all model types; `_hasAnyNamedPaths()` removed
- `_load()` passes all named paths (TDT, CTC, EOU, Sortformer) to C++
- `JSAdapter` parses CTC (`ctcModelPath`, `ctcModelDataPath`, `tokenizerPath`), EOU (`eouEncoderPath`, `eouDecoderPath`), and Sortformer (`sortformerPath`) path properties
- `loadTDTSessions` requires `encoderPath` and `decoderPath`, removes buffer fallback
- `loadCTCSessions` requires `ctcModelPath`, loads with C++-side temp staging for ONNX external data, reads tokenizer from `tokenizerPath`
- `loadEOUSessions` requires `eouEncoderPath` and `eouDecoderPath`, reads tokenizer from `tokenizerPath`
- `loadSortformerSessions` requires `sortformerPath`

## [0.1.10]

### Added
- CTC model support (`parakeet-ctc-0.6b`) with tokenizer.json-based vocabulary decoding
- End-of-Utterance (EOU) streaming model support (`parakeet-eou-120m-v1`) for real-time transcription
- Sortformer speaker diarization model support (`sortformer-4spk-v2`) with per-speaker labelled output
- Named file path parameters for CTC (`ctcModelPath`, `ctcModelDataPath`), EOU (`eouEncoderPath`, `eouDecoderPath`), and Sortformer (`sortformerPath`) models
- Shared `tokenizerPath` config for CTC and EOU tokenizer.json loading
- `modelType` configuration parameter (`'tdt'`, `'ctc'`, `'eou'`, `'sortformer'`) to select inference pipeline
- Integration tests for all model types (desktop and mobile)
- `nlohmann-json` vcpkg dependency for tokenizer.json parsing

### Changed
- C++ `ParakeetModel` refactored to support multiple model architectures with shared mel-spectrogram and encoder pipeline
- `_resolveFilePath` extended to map CTC/EOU/Sortformer file names to named config paths
- `_hasAnyNamedPaths()` added to detect any named path override (TDT or non-TDT)
- `_loadModelWeights` routes weight files by model type using `getRequiredModelFiles()`
- Mobile integration tests hardened with explicit `unloadWeights()` and `destroyInstance()` cleanup in `finally` blocks

### Fixed
- Tokenizer vocabulary validation rejects empty vocab after parsing
- JobEnded/Output race condition in C++ job tracker

## [0.1.9]

### Changed
- Logger type in `TranscriptionParakeetArgs` now uses `LoggerInterface` from `@qvac/logging` instead of a package-specific type, aligning with the shared logging interface used across all addons

## [0.1.7]

### Added
- Native C++ support for loading ONNX sessions directly from individual file paths (`encoderPath`, `encoderDataPath`, `decoderPath`, `vocabPath`, `preprocessorPath`)
- Encoder external data staging via temporary symlink directory, cleaned up after session creation
- Vocabulary loading directly from `vocabPath` when named paths are provided

### Changed
- `_load()` skips buffer-based `_loadModelWeights` when named paths are detected, reducing memory overhead
- `_downloadWeights()` short-circuits when named paths are provided

## [0.1.6]

### Added
- Individual named file path parameters (`encoderPath`, `encoderDataPath`, `decoderPath`, `vocabPath`, `preprocessorPath`) as alternative to `filePaths` map

### Fixed
- Removed unused `Loader` type and `Readable` import from type declarations; `loader` argument now typed as `unknown`

## [0.1.5]

### Added
- `NOTICE` file with full third-party dependency attributions
- `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` now included in the published npm package

### Changed
- S3 download script now requires `MODEL_S3_BUCKET` environment variable instead of hardcoded bucket

### Removed
- `@qvac/dl-hyperdrive` from `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies`

## [0.1.2]

### Added
- Unified `transcribe.js` script with CLI flags (`--file`, `--model`) replacing individual language scripts

### Changed
- Replaced multiple `if` status checks with `std::ranges::find` in `Addon.cpp`
- Extracted `computeFeatures()` and `runInferencePipeline()` helper functions in `ParakeetModel.cpp`
- Updated `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, and `download-models-s3.sh` documentation

### Removed
- Individual language transcription scripts (`es-transcribe.js`, `fr-transcribe.js`, `hr-transcribe.js`)
