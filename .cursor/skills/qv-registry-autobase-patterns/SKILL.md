# Registry Autobase Patterns

## What

Reference material for Autobase, HyperDB, Hyperdispatch, and multi-writer distributed database patterns used in the QVAC registry server. Covers schema design, blind pairing/peering, multi-writer deployment, RPC layer setup, and HyperDB query patterns.

## When to Use

- Working with Autobase configuration, apply functions, or multi-writer patterns
- Working with HyperDB schemas, collections, indexes, or query patterns
- Implementing or debugging blind pairing (invites) or blind peering (mirrors)
- Setting up Hyperdispatch routers or operation encoding
- Deploying or managing multi-writer instances (3-writer setup, writer rotation)
- Working with Hyperswarm networking, Protomux RPC, or peer discovery
- Debugging Corestore, Hypercore, or replication issues
